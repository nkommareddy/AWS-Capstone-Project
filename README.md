## Scenario <a name = "scenario-"></a>
XYZ University, a small, selective private university with a student population below 10,000, faces challenges due to high application volumes exceeding processing capacities. Consequently, the university's website application experiences suboptimal performance and sluggishness. Given the sensitive nature of storing applicants' private information, ensuring robust security measures is something extremely important. 



## Solution <a name = "solution-"></a>
Given the scenario, I was tasked with designing and constructing a comprehensive architecture for hosting a new web application in the AWS Cloud for XYZ University. The primary objectives are to ensure seamless support for all applicants, while guaranteeing high availability, scalability, load balancing, security, and optimal performance. This transition to cloud-based hosting will offer XYZ University a significantly more reliable alternative compared to their current data center hosting approach.
