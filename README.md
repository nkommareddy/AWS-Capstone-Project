# AWS-Capstone-Project

## Scenario 
XYZ University, a small, selective private university with a student population below 10,000, faces challenges due to high application volumes exceeding processing capacities. Consequently, the university's website application experiences suboptimal performance and sluggishness. Given the sensitive nature of storing applicants' private information, ensuring robust security measures is something extremely important. 



## Solution 
Given the scenario, I was tasked with designing and constructing a comprehensive architecture for hosting a new web application in the AWS Cloud for XYZ University. The primary objectives are to ensure seamless support for all applicants, while guaranteeing high availability, scalability, load balancing, security, and optimal performance. This transition to cloud-based hosting will offer XYZ University a significantly more reliable alternative compared to their current data center hosting approach.

### Phase One: Planning the design and estimating the cost

The following images are what I imagined my architecture and 12 month cost projection to look like initially. I quickly realized that the original architecture I designed included many unnecessary features and services. The changes I made along the way as well as the reasoning as to why I made those changes will be reflected in the documentation. Additionally, a final architectural diagram showing the final version of what my solution came to look like will be included at the end of the documentation.
